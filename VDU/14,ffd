VDU 15
This VDU turns page mode off.

When page mode is turned on the VDU drivers will not scroll the screen until Shift is pressed. When shift is released the VDU drivers will scroll approximately 75% of the number of lines in the current window before waiting again. <OS_Byte 117=>OS:OS_Byte117> is used to determine whether paged mode is enabled, and the line count before scrolling is stopped can be read and set with <OS_Byte 217=>OS:OS_Byte217>.
