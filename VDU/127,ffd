VDU 127
#Parent !Root
VDU 127 deletes the previous character.

Unless <VDU 23,16=>23,16> specifies no cursor motion after printing the cursor is moved back as if by <VDU 8=>8>. In <VDU 5=>5> mode the character position is solid filled with graphics background colour, in <VDU 4=>4> mode with text background colour (ie. a space is printed, even if character 32 has been redefined).
