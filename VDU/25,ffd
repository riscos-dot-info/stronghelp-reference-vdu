VDU 25
#Parent !Root
VDU 25,<command=>OS:OS_PlotIndex>,x;y;
This VDU executes a plot command. 

As the VDU system only accepts signed 16 bit coordinates this limits the maximum resolution for printing on large paper, so <OS_Plot=>OS:OS_Plot> should be used in preference as this allows signed 32 bit coordinates - thus allowing the VDU system to be upgraded in future.

It is also faster (and simpler) to use the SWI <OS_Plot=>OS:OS_Plot> directly.
