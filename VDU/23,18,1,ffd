Suspend/resume bitmap updates
This call allows an application to request that the kernel suspends updates to the framebuffer bitmap. This allows for a significant speed increase in the rendering time for a large amount of text, for example when redrawing a complete teletext page, because each time you plot a single character, it can cause the whole of the rest of the line to be re-rendered. 

When you switch out of suspend mode, the whole screen is refreshed in a single pass. 
	suspend = 0: screen update is enabled
	suspend = 1: screen update is suspended

Note that the appearance of the display is undefined is you cause a hardware scroll while in suspend mode.

Default is suspend = 0.
