VDU 23,{/}m{/}, 8 bytes of row definitions

This VDU redefines character /m/ in the system font. The rows are given by the 8 bytes from top to bottom. The pattern for a character can be read with <OS_Word 10=>OS:OS_Word10>.

Note that although the delete character (\<127>) can be redefined, it still cannot be printed.
