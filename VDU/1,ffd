VDU 1
#Parent !Root
VDU 1,{/}n{/}

VDU 1 sends the next byte to the printer stream only, provided that the printer stream has been enabled with <VDU 2=>2>. (Otherwise the next byte is ignored)

VDU 1 allows the printer ignore character (set with <OS_Byte 6=>OS:OS_Byte006>) and other characters not usually passed on by the VDU drivers to be sent to the printer via the VDU drivers.
