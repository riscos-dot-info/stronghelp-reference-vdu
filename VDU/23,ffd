VDU 23
#Parent !Root
VDU 23,<command=>23a>,nine parameters
Miscellaneous commands.
Though few of the commands use all of the nine parameters, they must always be present. In BASIC, you can use | to add eight zero bytes:

#tab Align right
VDU	23,0,10 |
=VDU	23,0,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Any extra zero bytes remaining after the 9 bytes used by the VDU 23 command are ignored (<VDU 0=>0> is a no-op).
